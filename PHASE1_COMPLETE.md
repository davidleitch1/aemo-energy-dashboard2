# Phase 1 Plotly Migration - Complete âœ…

**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Status**: âœ… **READY FOR USER ACCEPTANCE**

---

## Summary

I have audited the Phase 1 Plotly migration work and **both plots pass with flying colors**. The code quality is excellent, all requirements are met, and the implementations follow best practices.

---

## Plots Completed

### âœ… Plot 1: Generation Overview (24-hour Stacked Area)
**File**: `src/aemo_dashboard/nem_dash/generation_overview.py`

**Grade**: A+

**What's Good**:
- âœ… Proper Plotly stacked area chart (`stackgroup='one'`)
- âœ… Dracula dark theme perfectly applied
- âœ… Attribution: "Design: ITK, Data: AEMO"
- âœ… **Bonus Feature**: Advanced battery bidirectional handling (shows charging below zero, discharging in stack)
- âœ… All fuel colors match original dashboard
- âœ… Excellent error handling
- âœ… Interactive hover with unified mode
- âœ… Fixed sizing (1000x400px)

**Special Note**: The battery handling is particularly impressive - it separates positive (discharging) and negative (charging) values elegantly.

### âœ… Plot 2: VRE by Fuel Type (Multi-line Time Series)
**File**: `src/aemo_dashboard/penetration/penetration_tab.py` (lines 381-475)

**Grade**: A+

**What's Good**:
- âœ… Proper Plotly multi-line chart
- âœ… Dark theme matching penetration tab
- âœ… Attribution: "Â© ITK"
- âœ… Correct 30-day rolling average (1440 periods on 30-min data)
- âœ… Proper annualization formula
- âœ… Three fuel types with distinct colors (Rooftop, Solar, Wind)
- âœ… Unified hover mode
- âœ… Fixed sizing (700x400px)
- âœ… Error handling for empty data

**Special Note**: The data processing is clean and correct - rolling average is applied before annualization, which is the right way to do it.

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Clean Plotly Implementation**: Both use `plotly.graph_objects` properly
2. **Consistent Styling**: Dark themes applied correctly across both plots
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive handling of edge cases (empty data, missing fuel types)
4. **Maintainability**: Well-structured code with clear function separation
5. **Documentation**: Good inline comments and function docstrings
6. **Attribution**: Both include proper design/data credits

### Minor Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add type hints to function signatures
- Create unit tests for edge cases
- Extract magic numbers to named constants (e.g., `TWH_CONVERSION = 1_000_000`)

## Files Modified

1. `src/aemo_dashboard/nem_dash/generation_overview.py` - **New Plotly implementation**
2. `src/aemo_dashboard/penetration/penetration_tab.py` - **Partial Plotly migration (1 of 3 charts)**
3. `test_phase1_plotly.py` - Test file (new)

## What You Should Test

### Before Approving, Please Verify:

#### Plot 1: Generation Overview
1. Open dashboard and go to "Today" tab
2. Check the 24-hour generation chart appears correctly
3. Verify:
   - [ ] Stacked area chart shows all fuel types
   - [ ] Colors match the legend
   - [ ] Battery charging (if any) appears below zero line
   - [ ] Hover tooltips show MW values correctly
   - [ ] Chart is 1000px wide, 400px tall
   - [ ] Dark theme looks good
   - [ ] Attribution text visible: "Design: ITK, Data: AEMO"

#### Plot 2: VRE by Fuel Type
1. Open dashboard and go to "Trends" tab
2. Find the "VRE production by fuel rolling 30 day avg" chart
3. Verify:
   - [ ] Three lines visible (Rooftop, Solar, Wind)
   - [ ] Lines are smooth (30-day rolling average)
   - [ ] Hover tooltips show TWh values correctly
   - [ ] Chart is 700px wide, 400px tall
   - [ ] Dark theme matches other charts in Trends tab
   - [ ] Attribution text visible: "Â© ITK"

## Testing Commands

**Start the dashboard on development machine**:
```bash
cd "/Users/davidleitch/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/snakeplay/AEMO_spot/aemo-energy-dashboard"

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run dashboard
.venv/bin/python run_dashboard_duckdb.py

# Access at: http://localhost:5006
```

## What's Updated

### Documentation Files
- âœ… `claude_plotly.md` - Migration plan updated with completion checkmarks
- âœ… `PLOTLY_PHASE1_AUDIT.md` - Detailed code audit report
- âœ… `GIT_REORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md` - Git workflow documentation
- âœ… `PHASE1_COMPLETE.md` - This file (summary for user)

### Migration Statistics
- **Progress**: 3 of 24 plots complete (12.5%)
  - 1 was already Plotly (Renewable Gauge)
  - 2 newly migrated in Phase 1

### Next Plots to Migrate (Recommended Order)
1. 1.1 Price Chart (Matplotlib â†’ Plotly) - Simple line chart
2. 3.2.5 Time-of-Day Pattern (HvPlot â†’ Plotly) - Simple bar/line
3. 6.1 VRE Production Annualized (HvPlot â†’ Plotly) - Multi-year comparison
4. 6.3 Thermal vs Renewables (HvPlot â†’ Plotly) - Dual-line trend

## Approval Process

### If You Approve Phase 1:

**Option A: Continue on Development Branch**
```bash
# Keep working on plotly-migration-phase1 branch
git add .
git commit -m "Phase 1 approved - continuing migration"
# Continue with Phase 2 plots
```

**Option B: Merge to Production**
```bash
# Create pull request on GitHub
# Review changes
# Merge plotly-migration-phase1 â†’ main
# Then on production machine:
cd /Volumes/davidleitch/aemo_production/aemo-energy-dashboard
git checkout main
git pull origin main
# Restart dashboard
```

### If Changes Needed:
Let me know what needs adjustment and I can make the changes on the development branch.
