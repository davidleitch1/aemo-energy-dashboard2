# Prices Tab Implementation Summary

## Date: July 22, 2025

### What We Accomplished

#### 1. **Created a New Prices Tab**
- Added between "Generation mix" and "Pivot table" tabs
- Implemented lazy loading to avoid performance issues at startup
- Successfully integrated into the dashboard structure

#### 2. **Built Comprehensive UI Controls**
- **Region Selection**: Checkbox group allowing multi-region comparison (NSW1, QLD1, SA1, TAS1, VIC1)
- **Date Controls**: 
  - Quick presets: 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, All data
  - Manual date pickers for custom ranges
  - Dynamic date display showing selected period
- **Frequency Selection**: 5 min, 1 hour, Daily, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly aggregation
- **Smoothing Options**: None, 7-period MA, 30-period MA, Exponential (α=0.3)
- **Log Scale**: Checkbox for Y-axis log scaling with automatic handling of negative prices
- **Analyze Button**: Primary button to trigger data loading (avoiding automatic large data loads)

#### 3. **Implemented Interactive Price Chart**
- HvPlot line chart with Dracula theme colors
- Multi-region support with distinct colors per region
- Automatic data resampling based on frequency selection
- Smoothing algorithms applied when selected
- Log scale support with intelligent negative price handling (shifts values by |min_price| + 1)
- Hover tooltips showing region and price information
- Full pan, zoom, and save functionality

#### 4. **Fixed Critical Issues**
- **Datetime Type Mismatch**: Date pickers return `date` objects, but price adapter expects `datetime`
  - Solution: Convert dates to datetime before passing to adapter
  - Fixed errors like "can't compare datetime.datetime to datetime.date"
  
- **SETTLEMENTDATE Column**: Price data returns with SETTLEMENTDATE as index, not column
  - Solution: Reset index when needed for hvplot compatibility
  
- **Deprecated Pandas Aliases**: Updated frequency strings (5T→5min, H→h)

#### 5. **User Experience Improvements**
- Initial message: "Click 'Analyze Prices' to load data"
- Loading feedback: "Loading price data..." while fetching
- Error messages for missing region selection
- Clear visual hierarchy with grouped controls

### Current Issues

#### 1. **"All Data" Not Loading Properly**
- When "All data" is selected, it may not be loading the full historical range
- Likely issue: The date range calculation for "All data" uses `self.start_date` which might be limited
- Need to investigate what date range is actually available in the price parquet files

### Next Steps

#### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. **Fix "All Data" Date Range**
   - Check actual date range available in price parquet files
   - Update the "All data" logic to use the full available range
   - Consider querying the parquet file for min/max dates dynamically

2. **Add Data Availability Indicator**
   - Show users what date range is actually available
   - Display this info near the date controls

#### Future Enhancements (Still To Do)
1. **Statistics Table**
   - Average price by region for selected period
   - Price volatility (standard deviation)
   - Min/max prices with timestamps
   - Percentile analysis (25th, 50th, 75th, 95th)

2. **Price Band Analysis Chart**
   - Stacked column chart showing contribution by price bands:
     - Below $0
     - $0-$50
     - $51-$100
     - $101-$300
     - $301-$1000
     - Above $1000
   - Weighted average contribution to show price distribution

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Consider caching loaded data for quick parameter changes
   - Add progress bar for large data loads
   - Implement streaming updates for real-time price tracking

### Technical Notes

#### Data Flow
1. User selects parameters (regions, dates, frequency, etc.)
2. User clicks "Analyze Prices" button
3. Date objects converted to datetime objects
4. Price adapter loads data with automatic resolution selection
5. Data resampled to requested frequency
6. Smoothing applied if selected
7. Log scale transformation if enabled
8. HvPlot renders interactive chart
