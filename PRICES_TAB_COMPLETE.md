# Prices Tab Implementation - Complete

## Date: July 23, 2025

### Summary
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Prices tab for the AEMO Energy Dashboard with three interactive visualizations: price time series, statistics table, and price band contribution chart. All features are working with proper data handling and dark theme styling.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Fixed "All Data" Date Range Issue** ✅
- **Problem**: "All data" was using dashboard's default start date (1 day ago) instead of actual available data
- **Solution**: Changed to use actual data range from prices30.parquet (2020-01-01 onwards)
- **Result**: Users can now view 5+ years of historical price data

### 2. **Implemented Statistics Table** ✅
- **Dark-themed Tabulator widget** with Dracula color scheme
- **Regions as columns** for easy comparison
- **Comprehensive statistics**:
  - Count (number of data points)
  - Mean (average price)
  - Std Dev (standard deviation)
  - Min/Max values
  - Percentiles (25%, 50%, 75%, 95%)
  - Variance
  - CV% (Coefficient of Variation - relative volatility measure)
- **Zero decimal formatting** for cleaner display
- **Responsive width** with proper error handling

### 3. **Created Price Band Contribution Chart** ✅
- **Stacked bar chart** showing weighted contribution of price bands to mean price
- **Price bands**:
  - Below $0 (negative prices)
  - $0-$50 (low prices)
  - $51-$100 (moderate prices)
  - $101-$300 (high prices)
  - $301-$1000 (very high prices)
  - Above $1000 (extreme prices)
- **Features**:
  - Centered value labels on bars (no decimals, no $ sign)
  - Date range in title (e.g., "Last 30 days", "2020-01-01 to 2025-07-23")
  - Hover tooltips showing percentage and band average
  - Dracula theme colors matching dashboard style

### 4. **UI Improvements** ✅
- **Removed redundant headers** ("Statistics" and "Price Band Contribution") for cleaner layout
- **Fixed Tabulator initialization** issues (removed frozen_rows, added proper value parameter)
- **Enhanced CSS styling** for better dark theme support
- **Improved error messages** across all visualizations

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/aemo_dashboard/generation/gen_dash.py`
  - Lines 2691-2695: Fixed "All data" date range
  - Lines 2583-2620: Implemented statistics table with Tabulator
  - Lines 2884-2901: Statistics calculation with zero decimal formatting
  - Lines 2925-3044: Price band contribution calculation and visualization
  - Lines 2698-2706: Removed redundant section headers

### Key Implementation Notes
1. **Statistics Calculation**: Uses pandas describe() plus additional metrics (95th percentile, variance, CV%)
2. **Price Band Logic**: Calculates weighted contribution as (% time in band) × (average price in band)
3. **Dynamic Titles**: Chart title includes selected date range for context
4. **Label Positioning**: Only shows values > $5 to avoid cluttering small segments
5. **Error Handling**: All three visualizations handle errors gracefully with informative messages

## Data Flow
1. User selects regions and date range
2. Clicks "Analyze Prices" button
3. Price data loaded via price_adapter
4. Three visualizations update simultaneously:
   - Time series plot with optional smoothing/log scale
   - Statistics table with key metrics
   - Price band contribution chart
5. All visualizations reflect the same data selection

## Next Steps
While the Prices tab is now complete, potential future enhancements could include:
- Export functionality for statistics and charts
- Additional price metrics (e.g., price duration curves)
- Integration with other dashboard tabs for cross-analysis
- Real-time price alerts based on thresholds

## Testing Notes
- Tested with all date ranges (1 day to All data)
- Verified statistics calculations match expected values
- Confirmed price band contributions sum to mean price
- Checked multi-region comparisons work correctly
- Validated error handling for edge cases
