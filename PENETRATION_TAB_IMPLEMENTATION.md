# Penetration Tab Implementation Summary

*Date: July 19, 2025, 9:50 PM AEST*

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Created Smoothing Utilities ✅
**File**: `src/aemo_dashboard/shared/smoothing.py`
- Implemented `apply_ewm_smoothing()` function with configurable span
- Implemented `apply_centered_ma()` function for centered moving averages
- Ready for expansion with additional smoothing methods (LOESS, Savitzky-Golay)

### 2. Created Penetration Tab Module ✅
**Files**: 
- `src/aemo_dashboard/penetration/penetration_tab.py`
- `src/aemo_dashboard/penetration/__init__.py`

**Features Implemented**:
- Interactive region selector: [NEM, NSW1, QLD1, SA1, TAS1, VIC1]
- Interactive fuel selector: [VRE, Solar, Wind, Rooftop]
- VRE production annualised chart with EWM smoothing (span=30)
- Year-over-year comparison (2023, 2024, 2025)
- Data aggregation and annualisation calculations
- Error handling for missing data

### 3. Integrated with Main Dashboard ✅
**File Modified**: `src/aemo_dashboard/generation/gen_dash.py`
- Added import and instantiation of PenetrationTab
- Integrated tab into main dashboard tabs
- Added error handling for tab creation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. Uses `GenerationQueryManager` to fetch generation data
2. Queries 30-minute resolution data for full years
3. Filters by selected fuel types (VRE = Wind + Solar + Rooftop)
4. Groups by year and day of year
5. Applies EWM smoothing with span=30
6. Converts MW to annualised TWh

### Chart Specifications
- **X-axis**: Day of year (1-365)
- **Y-axis**: TWh annualised
- **Colors**: 
  - 2023: Light blue (#5DADE2)
  - 2024: Orange (#F39C12)
  - 2025: Green (#58D68D)
- **Styling**: Dark background, no gridlines, legend at bottom left

## Testing Results

All components tested successfully:
- ✅ Smoothing functions work correctly
- ✅ PenetrationTab instantiates without errors
- ✅ Layout creates successfully
- ✅ Data fetching works (445,350 rows retrieved)
- ✅ Chart generation completes
- ✅ Dashboard integration successful

## Known Issues Fixed

1. **Import Errors**: Removed unused `get_data_config` import
2. **Type Annotations**: Removed hvplot.Plot type annotation
3. **SettingWithCopyWarning**: Fixed by using `.copy()` on filtered DataFrame
4. **Column Name Mismatch**: Changed from `scadavalue` to `total_generation_mw`

## Next Steps

1. **Styling Refinement**: 
   - Fine-tune chart colors to exactly match screenshot
   - Adjust y-axis range and formatting
   - Add "© ITK" source attribution

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Consider caching yearly data
   - Optimize data aggregation queries

3. **Additional Charts**:
   - Implement VRE Production by Fuel chart (Image #2)
   - Implement Thermal vs Renewables chart (Image #3)

## How to Access

1. Start the dashboard:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/davidleitch/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/snakeplay/AEMO_spot/aemo-energy-dashboard
   DASHBOARD_PORT=5009 .venv/bin/python run_dashboard_duckdb.py
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:5009

3. Click on the "Penetration" tab

4. Use the Region and Fuel Type selectors to explore the data

## Summary

The VRE Production Annualised chart has been successfully implemented with EWM smoothing as requested. The chart shows year-over-year comparison of renewable energy production, with interactive controls for region and fuel type selection. The implementation follows the dashboard's architecture patterns and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.
