# LOESS Filter Implementation

## Date: July 23, 2025

### What Was Implemented

Successfully added LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) filter to the Prices tab with three preset configurations optimized for different analysis needs:

1. **LOESS (7 days, frac=0.05)** - For volatile data with local features
   - Days: 7 (reference for understanding, not used in calculation)
   - Fraction: 0.05 (5% of data points)
   - Best for preserving short-term price patterns and spikes
   - Adapts to local volatility changes

2. **LOESS (30 days, frac=0.1)** - For balanced smoothing
   - Days: 30 (reference for understanding)
   - Fraction: 0.1 (10% of data points)
   - Good balance between noise reduction and feature preservation
   - Suitable for most analysis tasks

3. **LOESS (90 days, frac=0.15)** - For trend analysis
   - Days: 90 (reference for understanding)
   - Fraction: 0.15 (15% of data points)
   - Stronger smoothing for identifying long-term trends
   - Reduces impact of short-term volatility

### Key Features

- **Adaptive Smoothing**: LOESS adapts to local data patterns unlike fixed-window methods
- **Non-parametric**: No assumptions about data distribution
- **Performance Optimized**: 
  - `it=0`: No robustness iterations for faster computation
  - `delta=0.01 * len(data)`: Approximation for speed on large datasets
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles insufficient data points
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing smoothing options

### Technical Details

- Added statsmodels dependency (v0.14.0) to project
- Uses `lowess` function from statsmodels.nonparametric
- Minimum points required: max(3, int(frac * data_length) + 1)
- Converts datetime index to numeric for LOESS computation
- Falls back to original data if smoothing fails

### How LOESS Works

1. **Local Regression**: Fits weighted regression to nearby points
2. **Adaptive Weights**: Points closer to target get higher weights
3. **Bandwidth Control**: `frac` parameter controls neighborhood size
4. **Smooth Output**: Creates smooth curve that follows data patterns

### Comparison with Other Methods

| Method | Feature Preservation | Smoothness | Speed | Best Use Case |
|--------|---------------------|------------|-------|---------------|
| Moving Average | Poor | Good | Fast | Simple trends |
| Savitzky-Golay | Excellent | Good | Fast | Spike preservation |
| LOESS | Very Good | Excellent | Slow | Complex patterns |
| EWM | Fair | Good | Fast | Real-time analysis |

### Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to the Prices tab
2. Select regions and time period
3. Choose one of the LOESS options from the Smoothing dropdown
4. Click "Analyze Prices"
5. Compare results:
   - LOESS (frac=0.05): Should show detailed patterns with light smoothing
   - LOESS (frac=0.1): Should show balanced smoothing
   - LOESS (frac=0.15): Should show strong smoothing for trends

### What to Look For

1. **Adaptive Behavior**: Notice how LOESS adapts to different volatility levels
2. **No Lag**: Unlike moving averages, LOESS doesn't introduce lag
3. **Smooth Curves**: Output should be smoother than Savitzky-Golay
4. **Performance**: May be slower on very large datasets (5+ years)

### Performance Considerations

- LOESS is computationally intensive (O(nÂ²) complexity)
- Large datasets (>10,000 points) may take several seconds
- The delta parameter helps speed up computation with minimal quality loss
- Consider using larger frac values for very large datasets

### Next Steps

1. Test LOESS implementation on various date ranges
2. Compare with Savitzky-Golay for different use cases
3. Provide feedback on parameter choices
4. Consider implementing Gaussian filter next
