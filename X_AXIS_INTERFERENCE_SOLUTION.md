# X-Axis Interference Solution

## Problem
When using the Prices tab and then switching to the Batteries tab, the x-axis range from the Prices tab was affecting the Batteries tab plots.

## Root Cause
The original implementation used `js_link` to connect x_range objects between plots. These JavaScript links persist in the browser's runtime and affect other tabs.

## Solution Attempted
1. **First attempt**: Changed from function attribute storage to local list - this didn't solve the issue because js_link still creates persistent connections
2. **Second attempt**: Tried `shared_axes='x'` - this failed because HoloViews Layout only accepts True/False, not 'x'
3. **Final solution**: Removed js_link approach entirely and use `shared_axes=True` in each tab's layout

## Current Implementation
- **Prices tab**: Uses `shared_axes=True` in the Layout opts (no js_link)
- **Batteries tab**: Uses `shared_axes=True` in the Layout opts  
- **Key change**: Removed the `link_x_ranges_hook` function that was creating js_link connections

## Why This Works
- `shared_axes=True` creates HoloViews-managed linking that is scoped to each layout
- No persistent JavaScript connections that cross tab boundaries
- Each tab maintains its own independent axis state

## Testing
1. Go to Prices tab and zoom/pan
2. Switch to Batteries tab  
3. Battery plots should show their own date range, not inherit from Prices tab

## Note
If `shared_axes=True` causes any issues (like UFuncTypeError), we may need to set it to False and accept that plots won't be linked within tabs.
