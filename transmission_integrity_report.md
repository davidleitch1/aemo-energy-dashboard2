# Transmission Data Integrity Check Report

## Summary of Findings

The comprehensive data integrity check reveals the following key issues:

### 1. **Missing July 7-8 Data**
- **Root Cause**: The transmission parquet file contains NO data for July 7-8, 2025
- **Data Range**: The file only contains data from July 9, 2025 19:25:00 to July 14, 2025 07:50:00
- **Total Records**: 4,674 records across 6 days

### 2. **Data Coverage Issues**
| Date | Record Count | Expected | Status |
|------|--------------|----------|---------|
| 2025-07-09 | 6 | 1728 | ❌ Critical - Only 0.3% of expected |
| 2025-07-10 | 6 | 1728 | ❌ Critical - Only 0.3% of expected |
| 2025-07-11 | 636 | 1728 | ⚠️ Warning - Only 36.8% of expected |
| 2025-07-12 | 1728 | 1728 | ✅ Complete |
| 2025-07-13 | 1728 | 1728 | ✅ Complete |
| 2025-07-14 | 570 | 1728 | ⚠️ Partial - Still collecting |

### 3. **Data Structure**
- **Columns**: All expected columns are present
  - settlementdate, interconnectorid, meteredmwflow, mwflow, exportlimit, importlimit, mwlosses
- **Interconnectors**: 6 interconnectors found (as expected)
  - N-Q-MNSP1, NSW1-QLD1, T-V-MNSP1, V-S-MNSP1, V-SA, VIC1-NSW1
- **No Duplicates**: No duplicate records found
- **No Null Values**: All critical columns have complete data

### 4. **Why July 7-8 Data Isn't Showing**
The backfill attempts have failed because:
1. The transmission data file was likely created or reset on July 9, 2025
2. July 9-10 data is severely incomplete (only 6 records each day)
3. July 11 data is partial (636 records vs 1728 expected)
4. Only July 12-13 have complete data

### 5. **Recommendations**

1. **Immediate Action**: Re-run the backfill for the missing dates:
   - July 7, 2025 (completely missing)
   - July 8, 2025 (completely missing)
   - July 9, 2025 (only 6 records)
   - July 10, 2025 (only 6 records)
   - July 11, 2025 (636 records - needs remaining ~1092 records)

2. **Root Cause**: Investigate why the transmission collector started late or failed to collect data before July 9

3. **Data Validation**: Add automated checks to ensure daily record counts meet expected thresholds

4. **Historical Data**: If older historical data is needed, the parquet file needs to be rebuilt from scratch

## Technical Details

- File size: 0.65 MB
- Records per interconnector (when complete): 288 per day (5-minute intervals)
- Total expected records per day: 1728 (6 interconnectors × 288 intervals)
- Data format: All data types are correct and consistent
