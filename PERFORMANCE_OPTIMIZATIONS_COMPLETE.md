# Performance Optimizations Complete ✅

*Date: July 19, 2025*

## Problem Identified

The dashboard was taking **12.74 seconds** to load "All Available Data" (5+ years) due to:
- Loading **889,446 records** even with pre-aggregated views
- HybridQueryManager using inefficient chunk loading with LIMIT/OFFSET
- Each chunk taking ~0.55 seconds to load

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Direct DuckDB Query Execution ✅

**Changed**: Replaced `query_with_progress()` with direct `conn.execute(query).df()`

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates inefficient LIMIT/OFFSET chunking
- DuckDB handles large result sets efficiently
- Expected 10-20x performance improvement

**Files Modified**:
- `src/aemo_dashboard/generation/generation_query_manager.py`
  - Line 108: Direct query for generation data
  - Line 181: Direct query for capacity utilization
  - Line 224: Direct query for fuel capacities

### 2. Daily Aggregation for Long Ranges ✅

**Added**: Automatic daily aggregation for date ranges > 365 days

**Resolution Selection**:
- **< 7 days**: 5-minute resolution
- **7-365 days**: 30-minute resolution  
- **> 365 days**: Daily aggregation (NEW)

**Benefits**:
- Reduces "All Available Data" from 889,446 to ~2,000 records
- 400x data reduction for long ranges
- Maintains visual accuracy for overview displays

**Implementation**:
```python
if days_diff > 365:
    resolution = 'daily'
    view_name = 'daily_generation_by_fuel'
```

### 3. Optimized Cache Keys ✅

**Improved**: Cache keys now include actual resolution used
- Prevents cache misses when switching between auto and manual resolution
- Better cache utilization

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimizations:
- **All Available Data**: 12.74 seconds
- **Records Loaded**: 889,446
- **Memory Impact**: High

### After Optimizations:
- **All Available Data**: < 1 second (expected)
- **Records Loaded**: ~2,000 (daily aggregation)
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal

### Performance Gains:
- **10-20x faster** for medium date ranges (direct queries)
- **400x faster** for long date ranges (daily aggregation)
- **Better cache hits** with improved cache keys

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Load Times**:
   ```bash
   # Run dashboard and select "All Available Data"
   .venv/bin/python run_dashboard_duckdb.py
   ```

2. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Should see "Auto-selected daily aggregation" for long ranges
   - No more "chunk_load" warnings
   - Query times should be < 1 second

3. **Verify Data Accuracy**:
   - Daily aggregation should show same trends
   - Total generation values should be consistent
   - Fuel mix percentages should match

## Next Steps

1. **Progressive Loading UI** (Optional)
   - Add loading spinner during queries
   - Show progress for any remaining long operations
   - Improve perceived performance

2. **Further Optimizations** (If Needed)
   - Weekly aggregation for 1-5 year ranges
   - Monthly aggregation for 5+ year ranges
   - Materialized views for common queries

## Summary

The performance issue has been addressed with two key optimizations:
1. **Direct DuckDB queries** eliminate inefficient chunking
2. **Daily aggregation** dramatically reduces data volume for long ranges

The dashboard should now load "All Available Data" in under 1 second instead of 12+ seconds.
