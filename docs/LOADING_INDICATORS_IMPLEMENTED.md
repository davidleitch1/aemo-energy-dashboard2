# Loading Indicators Implementation Complete

*Date: July 19, 2025, 9:10 PM AEST*

## Summary

Added loading/spinning indicators to the Average Price Analysis dashboard to provide user feedback during long-running data operations.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Loading Infrastructure
- Added `loading_spinner` component using Panel's `pn.indicators.LoadingSpinner`
- Created helper methods `_show_loading(message)` and `_hide_loading()`
- Utilized Panel's built-in `loading` parameter on containers

### 2. Loading States Added

#### During Data Integration (30-60 seconds)
- Shows: "Integrating data (this may take 30-60 seconds for large date ranges)..."
- Triggered when: User clicks "Update Analysis" button
- Location: `_on_update_analysis()` method

#### During Price Calculations (5-10 seconds)
- Shows: "Calculating aggregated prices..."
- Triggered when: Table is being recalculated
- Location: `_calculate_and_update_table()` method

### 3. User Experience Improvements

**Before:**
- Blank screen or frozen UI during data loading
- No feedback that processing was happening
- Users might think the app crashed

**After:**
- Clear loading messages explain what's happening
- Spinning indicator shows activity
- Different messages for different phases
- Loading cleared on both success and error

### 4. Error Handling
- Loading indicators are properly hidden on errors
- Error messages replace loading spinner
- Prevents stuck loading states

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/aemo_dashboard/analysis/price_analysis_ui.py`

### Key Changes

1. **Added loading spinner initialization** (line 123-129):
   ```python
   self.loading_spinner = pn.indicators.LoadingSpinner(
       size=50, 
       value=False,
       color='primary',
       bgcolor='light',
       name='Loading data...'
   )
   ```

2. **Added helper methods** (lines 636-653):
   ```python
   def _show_loading(self, message: str = "Loading data..."):
       """Show loading indicator in the tabulator container"""
       
   def _hide_loading(self):
       """Hide loading indicator"""
   ```

3. **Integrated loading states** in:
   - `_on_update_analysis()` - Shows during data integration
   - `_calculate_and_update_table()` - Shows during calculations
   - Error handlers - Hides on any error

## Testing

To test the loading indicators:
1. Navigate to the Average Price Analysis tab
2. Select a large date range (e.g., "All" data)
3. Click "Update Analysis"
4. You should see:
   - "Integrating data..." message with spinner
   - Then "Calculating aggregated prices..." 
   - Finally the data table

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding loading indicators to:
- Other dashboard tabs (Generation, Station Analysis, etc.)
- Initial dashboard startup
- Auto-refresh operations
- Export operations

## Benefits

- **Better UX**: Users know the system is working
- **Reduced confusion**: Clear messaging about what's happening
- **Professional appearance**: Modern loading states
- **Prevents multiple clicks**: Users won't repeatedly click buttons thinking nothing happened
