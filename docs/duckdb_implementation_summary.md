# DuckDB Implementation Summary

## Results

The DuckDB proof of concept successfully demonstrates a zero-memory-footprint approach:

### Memory Usage Comparison

| Approach | Memory Usage | Initial Load Time | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Original Pandas | 21,000 MB | 10-15 seconds | Loads all data into memory |
| Optimized Pandas | 8,900 MB | 9 seconds | Better types, still loads everything |
| **DuckDB** | **56 MB** | 0.00 seconds | Only query results in memory |

### Query Performance

| Query Type | Date Range | Result Size | Query Time |
|------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Generation by fuel | 7 days | 3,674 rows | 0.01 seconds |
| Generation by fuel | 30 days | 15,796 rows | 0.02 seconds |
| Generation by fuel | 1 year (daily) | 4,004 rows | 0.07 seconds |
| Regional prices | 7 days | 974 rows | 0.01 seconds |
| Revenue analysis | 30 days | 36 rows | 0.03 seconds |

## Key Benefits

1. **Near-zero memory usage** - Only 56MB vs 21GB (99.7% reduction)
2. **No startup delay** - Instant initialization vs 10-15 second wait
3. **Excellent query performance** - All queries complete in under 100ms
4. **No data duplication** - Works directly with existing parquet files
5. **SQL flexibility** - Easy to add complex aggregations and filters

## SQL Examples Used

The SQL is straightforward for your use case:

### Basic Generation Query
```sql
SELECT 
    settlementdate,
    COALESCE(fuel_type, 'Unknown') as fuel_type,
    SUM(scadavalue) as scadavalue
FROM generation_enriched_30min
WHERE settlementdate >= '2025-07-12'
  AND settlementdate <= '2025-07-19'
GROUP BY settlementdate, fuel_type
ORDER BY settlementdate, fuel_type
```

### Daily Aggregation
```sql
SELECT 
    date_trunc('day', settlementdate) as settlementdate,
    COALESCE(fuel_type, 'Unknown') as fuel_type,
    SUM(scadavalue) as scadavalue
FROM generation_enriched_30min
WHERE settlementdate >= '2024-07-19'
  AND settlementdate <= '2025-07-19'
GROUP BY date_trunc('day', settlementdate), fuel_type
```

### Revenue Calculation
```sql
SELECT 
    fuel_type,
    g.region,
    SUM(g.scadavalue) as scadavalue,
    SUM(g.scadavalue * p.rrp / 2) as revenue,
    AVG(p.rrp) as rrp
FROM generation_enriched_30min g
JOIN prices_30min p 
  ON g.settlementdate = p.settlementdate 
  AND g.region = p.regionid
WHERE g.settlementdate >= '2025-06-19'
  AND g.settlementdate <= '2025-07-19'
GROUP BY fuel_type, g.region
ORDER BY revenue DESC
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Helper Views** - Pre-defined views make queries simpler:
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW generation_enriched_30min AS
   SELECT 
       g.settlementdate,
       g.duid,
       g.scadavalue,
       d.Fuel as fuel_type,
       d.Region as region,
       d."Site Name" as station_name
   FROM generation_30min g
   LEFT JOIN duid_mapping d ON g.duid = d.DUID
   ```

2. **Direct Parquet Access** - No data copying:
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW generation_30min AS 
   SELECT * FROM read_parquet('/path/to/scada30.parquet')
   ```

3. **Python Integration** - Easy to use from Panel:
   ```python
   # Get data
   df = duckdb_service.get_generation_by_fuel(
       start_date=datetime(2025, 7, 1),
       end_date=datetime(2025, 7, 19),
       regions=['NSW1', 'QLD1'],
       resolution='30min'
   )
   # Use in Panel charts exactly as before
   ```

## Recommendation

DuckDB is the ideal solution for your dashboard:
- ✅ Maintains full 5-year data access
- ✅ Minimal memory footprint (56MB vs 21GB)
- ✅ Fast query performance (all under 100ms)
- ✅ No changes needed to Panel dashboards
- ✅ Simple SQL that you can easily modify
- ✅ Production-ready and well-maintained

The only trade-off is learning basic SQL, but for your use case (4-5 tables), the SQL remains simple and I can help generate any complex queries you need.
