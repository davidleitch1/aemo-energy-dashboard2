# AEMO System Migration Status Report

*Date: July 20, 2025, 9:30 PM AEST*  
*Migration Duration: ~2 hours*

## Executive Summary

Successfully migrated AEMO Energy System from iCloud storage to local SSD storage on M2 Mac production machine. Both repositories (aemo-data-updater and aemo-energy-dashboard2) are deployed and operational, with minor issues being resolved.

## Migration Steps Completed

### Phase 1: Repository Preparation ✅
- Created clean dashboard repository (aemo-energy-dashboard2) without secrets
- Pushed both repositories to GitHub successfully
- aemo-data-updater: https://github.com/davidleitch1/aemo-data-updater
- aemo-energy-dashboard2: https://github.com/davidleitch1/aemo-energy-dashboard2 (public)

### Phase 2: Production Directory Setup ✅
- Created production directory structure at `~/aemo_production/`
- Successfully cloned both repositories from GitHub
- Directory structure:
  ```
  ~/aemo_production/
  ├── aemo-data-updater/
  ├── aemo-energy-dashboard2/
  ├── data/
  ├── logs/
  └── backup/
  ```

### Phase 3: Data Migration ✅
- Copied all parquet files from iCloud to production:
  - Source: `/Users/davidleitch/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/snakeplay/AEMO_spot/aemo-data-updater/data 2/`
  - Destination: `/Users/davidleitch/aemo_production/data/`
- Also copied `gen_info.pkl` from genhist directory
- All data files successfully migrated

### Phase 4: Configuration Updates ✅
- Created .env files for both services
- Updated all paths to point to production locations
- Added Twilio credentials for SMS alerts
- Configured email alerts

### Phase 5: Virtual Environment Setup ✅
- Successfully installed Python 3.12.11 environments
- All dependencies installed via uv
- Both services tested and can start

## Current Status

### Data Collector (aemo-data-updater)
- **Status**: Running with intermittent issues
- **Working collectors**:
  - ✅ 5-minute prices
  - ✅ 5-minute generation (SCADA)
  - ✅ 5-minute transmission
  - ✅ Rooftop solar (30-minute)
- **Issues**:
  - ⚠️ 30-minute trading files returning 403 errors
  - ⚠️ Hardcoded paths in unified_collector.py initially caused writes to wrong location
  - ⚠️ Collector loses file history on restart, causing temporary 403 errors

### Dashboard (aemo-energy-dashboard2)
- **Status**: Ready to test
- **Configuration**: Complete with correct paths
- **Testing**: Pending - waiting for collector to stabilize

## Key Issues Encountered

### 1. Git Authentication
- GitHub now requires Personal Access Tokens instead of passwords
- Resolved by making dashboard repository public

### 2. URL Case Sensitivity
- AEMO URLs are case-sensitive (CURRENT vs Current)
- Fixed by updating URLs in unified_collector.py

### 3. Hardcoded Paths
- unified_collector.py had hardcoded iCloud paths
- Lines 39-40 needed updating to use production paths
- This caused initial writes to wrong location

### 4. Collector Initialization
- Collector doesn't persist `last_files` state between restarts
- Causes it to see all AEMO files as "new" on startup
- Results in 403 errors when trying to download 4000+ files
- Stabilizes after a few cycles

## Next Steps

1. **Let collector stabilize** (1-2 hours)
   - Allow it to build up file history
   - Monitor for successful data collection

2. **Test dashboard functionality**
   - Verify all tabs load correctly
   - Check data visualization
   - Confirm memory usage is reasonable

3. **Fix collector initialization issue**
   - Implement persistence for last_files state
   - Or check existing parquet timestamps on startup

4. **Complete migration finalization**
   - Set up automatic startup scripts
   - Configure backup sync to iCloud
   - Stop old collectors on dev machine

## Performance Metrics

- **Data Location**: Local SSD (fast access)
- **Memory Usage**: TBD (dashboard not yet tested)
- **Collector Performance**: 
  - Cycle time: 3-95 seconds depending on data volume
  - Success rate: 5-7 out of 7 collectors working

## Lessons Learned

1. **Check for hardcoded paths** - The unified_collector.py override caused confusion
2. **Collector state persistence** - Important for avoiding initialization issues
3. **GitHub authentication** - Use tokens, not passwords
4. **URL case sensitivity** - AEMO endpoints are inconsistent

## Migration Result

✅ **Success with minor issues** - System is operational on production machine with local SSD storage. Main functionality working, minor issues being resolved.
