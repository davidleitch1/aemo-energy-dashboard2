# Rooftop Solar Data Backfill Complete

*Date: July 19, 2025, 11:10 PM AEST*

## Summary

Successfully backfilled all missing rooftop solar data for 2024-2025 from AEMO archives.

## What Was Done

1. **Created Backfill Script**: `backfill_rooftop_2024_2025.py`
   - Downloads weekly archive files from NEMWEB
   - Extracts nested zip files containing 30-minute CSV data
   - Processes only "MEASUREMENT" files (not SATELLITE)
   - Handles date filtering and deduplication

2. **Backfilled Missing Data**:
   - **2024**: August 3 - December 31 (153 days) - 72,010 records added
   - **2025**: January 1 - June 17 (168 days) - 80,170 records added
   - Total: 152,180 new records added

3. **Verification Results**:
   - Total records: 971,220 (up from 819,040)
   - Date range: 2020-01-01 to 2025-07-19
   - 2024 coverage: 99.5% complete
   - 2025 coverage: 99.2% complete
   - Data quality: All values within expected ranges (0-5,494 MW)

## Files Modified

- Created: `/aemo-data-updater/backfill_rooftop_2024_2025.py`
- Updated: `/aemo-data-updater/data 2/rooftop30.parquet`

## Impact

- VRE (Variable Renewable Energy) charts now have complete rooftop data
- Year-over-year comparisons for 2024-2025 are now accurate
- Seasonal patterns (summer peak) are properly represented
- Missing ~20-30 TWh of annualised renewable generation has been restored

## Next Steps

1. Test VRE charts in dashboard to confirm proper display
2. No further rooftop data backfill needed - coverage is excellent (>99%)
3. Consider setting up automated monitoring to prevent future gaps

## Technical Notes

- Archive URL: `https://nemweb.com.au/Reports/ARCHIVE/ROOFTOP_PV/ACTUAL/`
- Files are weekly archives published every Thursday
- Each weekly file contains ~336 nested zip files (one per 30-minute interval)
- Processing time: ~2 minutes for 47 weekly files

The rooftop solar data is now complete and ready for analysis.
