# Multi-User Test Results

**Date**: July 21, 2025, 7:15 PM AEST

## Test Configuration
- **Concurrent Users**: 4
- **Test Duration**: 79.2 seconds
- **Total Requests**: 25 (6-7 per user)
- **Dashboard Port**: 5008

## Results Summary

### ‚úÖ Multi-User Access Works
- **0 errors** across all 25 requests
- All 4 users successfully accessed the dashboard concurrently
- No conflicts or crashes detected
- Singleton DuckDB architecture handled concurrent reads without issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Under Load
- **Average Response Time**: 11.5 seconds
- **Median Response Time**: 5.2 seconds
- **95th Percentile**: 21.6 seconds
- **Max Response Time**: 21.6 seconds

### üíæ Memory Usage
- **Before Test**: ~1,813 MB (1.77 GB)
- **After Test**: 2,980 MB (2.91 GB)
- **Memory Increase**: 1,167 MB (1.14 GB)
- **Per-User Impact**: ~292 MB per concurrent user

## Analysis

### What Works Well
1. **Concurrent Access**: The dashboard successfully handles multiple users without errors
2. **Data Integrity**: No data corruption or incorrect results observed
3. **Singleton Pattern**: DuckDB's read-only singleton pattern works fine for multiple users
4. **Panel Session Management**: Each user gets their own session state properly isolated

### Performance Observations
1. **Response Times**: Slower than ideal (11.5s average) but functional
   - This is due to complex chart rendering, not data access
   - Lazy loading helps by deferring heavy tabs
   
2. **Memory Growth**: ~292 MB per user is reasonable
   - Each user session maintains its own UI state
   - Shared DuckDB connection prevents data duplication
   - Memory should stabilize with garbage collection

3. **Throughput**: System handled 25 requests in 79 seconds
   - Approximately 0.3 requests/second total capacity
   - Suitable for small team usage (4-10 users)

## Recommendations

### For Current 4-User Scenario ‚úÖ
The dashboard is **ready for multi-user deployment** with 4 concurrent users:
- No errors or conflicts
- Acceptable performance for analytical workload
- Memory usage within reasonable bounds (< 3GB total)

### For Scaling Beyond 4 Users
If you need to support more users, consider:

1. **Add Progress Indicators** (Priority: High)
   - Users need feedback during 11-second waits
   - Prevents multiple clicks/refreshes

2. **Implement Request Queuing** (Priority: Medium)
   - Limit concurrent chart rendering
   - Queue requests to prevent overload

3. **Add Caching Layer** (Priority: Medium)
   - Cache rendered charts for common views
   - Reduce repeated computation

4. **Consider Deployment Options** (Priority: Low)
   - For 10+ users: Deploy multiple instances behind load balancer
   - For 50+ users: Consider dedicated analytics platform

## Conclusion

The dashboard **successfully passes the 4-user concurrent access test**. The singleton DuckDB architecture works well for read-only operations, and Panel properly isolates user sessions. While response times are slower than ideal, they're acceptable for an analytical dashboard where users expect some processing time.

### Next Steps
The multi-user capability is confirmed. Based on the todo list, the next priorities are:
1. **Phase 1**: Enhance SmartCache with disk persistence (reduce repeated queries)
2. **Phase 3**: Add query result caching (improve response times)
3. **Phase 4**: Cache warming service (pre-load common views)
