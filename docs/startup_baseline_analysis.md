# Dashboard Startup Baseline Analysis

**Test Date**: July 21, 2025, 5:49 PM

## Startup Timeline

Based on log analysis, here's the startup sequence:

### 1. **Initial Start** (17:49:42.713)
- Logging configured
- First HTTP request received at 17:49:43.141 (0.4s after start)

### 2. **Core Initialization** (17:49:43.232 - 17:49:43.308)
- HybridQueryManager initialized with 200MB cache
- GenerationQueryManager initialized
- DUID mappings loaded (528 mappings)
- First data query starts (5-minute resolution)
- **Duration**: ~0.6 seconds

### 3. **Generation Tab Loading** (17:49:43.236 - 17:50:02.986)
- Loading 224,925 generation records
- Processing unknown DUIDs
- Creating initial plots
- **Duration**: ~19.7 seconds

### 4. **Other Tabs Initialization** (17:49:53.672 - 17:50:03.175)
- NEM Dashboard tab components
- Price Analysis tab loading
- Station Analysis tab initialization
- Penetration tab (loading 2+ years of data)
- Auto-update started
- **Duration**: ~9.5 seconds (overlaps with generation)

## Total Startup Time

**From process start to dashboard ready**: **~20.5 seconds**

### Breakdown by Component:

1. **Panel/Framework initialization**: 0.4s
2. **DuckDB connection + views**: 0.6s  
3. **Generation tab (default)**: 19.7s
   - Data loading: ~5s
   - Plot creation: ~14s
4. **Other tabs**: 9.5s (parallel)

## Key Bottlenecks Identified

1. **Generation Tab Plot Creation** (14+ seconds)
   - The main delay is not data loading but plot generation
   - Processing 224,925 records into visualizations

2. **Penetration Tab** 
   - Loading 2+ years of historical data on startup
   - Years 2022-2025 all loaded immediately

3. **Sequential Tab Creation**
   - All tabs created at startup, not on-demand

## Opportunities for Improvement

1. **Lazy Tab Loading**: Don't create all tabs at startup
2. **Plot Optimization**: Streamline generation plot creation
3. **Data Aggregation**: Pre-aggregate common views
4. **Disk Caching**: Cache expensive queries that don't change often

## Memory Usage

Current process is using 2.5GB (3.8% of system memory) after startup.

## Recommendations

With the enhanced SmartCache with disk persistence, we could cache:
- The 224,925 generation records (changes every 5 minutes)
- Penetration tab historical data (rarely changes)
- Station analysis DUID mappings (static)

This could reduce startup time from **20.5 seconds to <5 seconds**.
